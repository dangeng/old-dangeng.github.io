### Hello, world!

I've been meaning to start a blog for the longest time, and now with school out the way I've finally got this thing up and running. I'm not really sure what to expect, but here goes nothing...

I'm really looking to keep the subject of this blog open. Whatever cool or interesting is going on around me, I'll probably write a post or two about it. Essentially, I think this site will act as a sort of journal / travelogue / sketchpad / idea book / (very public) diary. I will say, however, that I am terribly fascinated by math, physics, computers and that sort of thing and the majority of this blog will probably be dedicated to that!

Anyways, here's me throwing this little blog into the great unknown. Hope you guys like it :)
