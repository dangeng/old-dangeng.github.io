### The Elusive Fractal Definition

Most people have seen fractals and would have no trouble categorizing a picture as fractal-like, yet it is surprisingly hard to find a good formal definition for what a "fractal" is. Most fractals are self-similar: zooming into any part of the structure will reveal the same patterns at any scale. For example, some famous fractals include the Koch Snowflake:

Or the Sierpinski Triangle:

</center>

Both of these fractals look _exactly_ the same on all different scales. Zooming into a section of the Sierpinski Triangle just reveals more triangles, and zooming into a tip of the Koch Snowflake just reveals more jagged edges. So maybe we can use 'self-similarity' as a condition for fractalness? Nope. Turns out there are some fractals that are self-similart, but not _perfectly_. The most famous of these "quasi-self-similar" fractals is probably the Mandelbrot Set. As a whole, the fractal looks like this:

And as we zoom in, we can see tinier Mandelbrot sets. Here's one at about 200,000 times magnification:

</center>

And one at about 10 trillion times magnification:

</center>

These zooms look pretty much like the Mandelbrot set (albeit they're rotated a bit and the surroundings have changed quite drastically). But turns out that some parts of the set don't look anything like the Mandelbrot set at all! Take this one for instance, at around 740 million times zoom:

</center>

Or this one, at about 60 billion times zoom:

Does this mean we have to chuck our "self-similarity" definition out the window? Pretty much. 

### Fractal Dimensions

Then how else can we define what a fractal is? Well, we can actually take advantage of one more interesting feature of fractals: dimensionality. A line is one dimensional, and square is two dimensional, and a cube is three dimensional. Put in a different way, doubling the length of a line will double it's length (quite obviously). But doubling the side lengths of a square will quadruple it's area, and doubling the side lengths of a cube will increase the volume by a factor of 8. Essentially, with a dimension of $$ d $$, scaling by a scale factor of $$ s $$ will increase the "area enclosed" (area, volume, etc...) by a factor of $$ s^d $$.

So what's the "dimension" of a fractal, say the Koch Snowflake? Well, obviously the snowflake lives in a 2-D space, but what if we asked how scaling changes its area? Using this route, some fairly simple calculations show that the snowflake actually has a dimension of $$ \log_3(4) $$! That means if we were to double the size of a Koch Snowflake, the enclosed area would increase by a factor of $$ 2^{\log_3(4)} $$.

### Fractal Flames



This does beg the question however: Are these things really fractals?
