### The Elusive Fractal Definition

Most people have seen fractals and would have no trouble categorizing a picture as fractal-like, yet it is surprisingly hard to find a good formal definition for what a "fractal" is. Most fractals are self-similar: zooming into any part of the structure will reveal the same patterns at any scale. For example, some famous fractals include the Koch Snowflake:

Or the Sierpinski Triangle:

</center>

Both of these fractals look _exactly_ the same on all different scales. Zooming into a section of the Sierpinski Triangle just reveals more triangles, and zooming into a tip of the Koch Snowflake just reveals more jagged edges. So maybe we can use 'self-similarity' as a condition for fractalness? Nope. Turns out there are some fractals that are self-similart, but not _perfectly_. The most famous of these "quasi-self-similar" fractals is probably the Mandelbrot Set. As a whole, the fractal looks like this:

And as we zoom in, we can see tinier Mandelbrot sets. Here's one at about 200,000 times magnification:

</center>

And one at about 10 trillion times magnification:

</center>

These zooms look pretty much like the Mandelbrot set (albeit they're rotated a bit and the surroundings have changed quite drastically). But turns out that some parts of the set don't look anything like the Mandelbrot set at all! Take this one for instance, at around 740 million times zoom:

<center>

</center>

Or this one, at about 60 billion times zoom:

Does this mean we have to chuck our "self-similarity" definition out the window? Pretty much. 

### Fractal Dimensions

Then how else can we define what a fractal is? Well, we can actually take advantage of one more interesting feature of fractals: dimensionality. A line or a curve is one dimensional because we only need to specify one parameter to locate a point on a curve (think number line). A plane or some surface is two dimensional because it needs two parameters to define a point on a surface (for example, I could say go one mile north, and three miles east and that would mark out a specific point).

So what's the "dimension" of a fractal, say the Koch Snowflake? Well, the snowflake is just a line, right? But it's also an infinitely jagged line, and it turns out to be infinite in length! So it's not exactly one dimensional---it's much too complex for that---and it's not exactly two dimensional. We need more than just one parameter to specify a point on the snowflake, but two is too much. It turns out the dimension of the Koch Snowflake is actually $$ \log_3(4) = 1.262...$$!

This kind of non-integer dimension is called a [Hausdorff dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) and is particularly useful in classifying fractals. The Hausdorff dimension for the Sierpenski Triangle (from above) is $$ log(3)/log(2) = 1.585... $$.

### Fractal Flames



This does beg the question however: Are these things really fractals?
