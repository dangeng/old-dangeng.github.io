excerpt: The strange relationship between pi and gravity, and how the french caused it
---

Take out a calculator and enter 

$$ {\pi}^2 $$

you should get something like

$$ 9.8696 $$

Now if you're a gigantic physics junkie this number should immediately strike you as familiar. In fact, $$ \pi $$ squared is incredibly close the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth, $$ g $$, which takes on a value of about $$ 9.8 \frac{m}{s^2} $$. 

At first glance, it seems like this should just be a complete coincidence. After all, how does the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter have anything to do with the acceleration of gravity on some wholly unremarkable speck of dust floating in a vast universe?

Then again, $$ \pi $$ does seem to pop up in some of the most unexpected places. For instance, $$ \pi $$ appears in [the probability that any two randomly choosen integers are coprime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBhSi_PwHU&t=639s), [Euler's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_identity), and physical constants, such as the [permeability of vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)).

However, $$ g $$ is also an incredibly arbitrary number. It's not just the acceleration due to gravity. It's the acceleration due to gravity at sea level, at $$ 45^{\circ} $$ latitude, on the third planet from a completely unremarkable star in a completely unremarkable galaxy.

This coincidence has not gone unnoticed. For example, [this thread](http://www.scienceforums.net/topic/62516-why-does-pi-squared-g/) has some very colorful (to say the least) suggestions for why the coincidence exists. Among these is the idea that the relationship stems from a (totally undocumented) theory called ORBITS or that it might have something to do with a mysterious "gamma factor."

There is in fact an explanation and it doesn't have anything to do with "ORBITS" or the "gamma factor." Oddly enough, it actually has to do with Frenchmen.
