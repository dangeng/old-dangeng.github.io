excerpt: How to reach 100,000 people with a single survey

### Class of 2020

Test

In this age of technology, tech savvy kids are always looking to utilize social media to augment their lives. For example, this past spring college admissions came out. Inevitably, as kids figured out which colleges they were attending, Facebook "groups" started to pop up. For example, the "University of Michigan Class of 2020" group boasted more than 18,000 members, all posting on a virtual wall asking about everything from which classes to take to where the best food was to which frats to rush. These bright and slightly naive pre-frosh, eager to make the best impression on their fellow classmates, quickly answered each and every one of the thousands of posts. 

Soon after joining one of the University of Michigan group, my friend and I quickly realized we could reach a termendous number of people just by writing a post in the group. But what could we possibly do with an audience of that size? A survey of course! We needed a survey that was simple, that people mindlessly browsing their Facebook feed could do in a minute or less without much thought, and that was hopefully fun. What we eventually settled on was the "[Aesthetics Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhZn0rNcjnSBVY_LjgMr08SReBNQCFEeD7SlLBrvzUq6nyMw/viewform)" (see below). But why stop at just the Umich group? Why not hit as many groups as we could? From there, we posted our survey on the University of Maryland, UCLA, BU, and some 20 other Class of 2020 groups. With each group came thousands of incredibly enthusiastic college admits completely willing to take a minute of their time to complete the survey. All said and done, we had reached over 100,000 (non-unique) people and had over 900 responses.

Although we technically reached over 100,000 non-unique people(users can be in more than one group), there are quite a few downsides to this method. First off, the population is almost entirely homogenous in demographics. Just about every single person would be a 17 or 18 year old and most would be come from at least moderately well-off families (they're going to college after all). Also, due to the way Facebook chooses what posts to put in a user's feed, most likely the survey reached less than 100,000 people. And finally, this method can only be used during the spring and summer months right after college decisions come out. But all in all, it's a nice little way to see what people think.

### [The Aesthetics Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhZn0rNcjnSBVY_LjgMr08SReBNQCFEeD7SlLBrvzUq6nyMw/viewform)

The survey was simple enough (as it should be!). Simply rate, on a scale from 1-10, 12 different images based on how beautiful you think it is. The images were:

1. van Gogh's _Starry Night_
2. Turner's _The Slave Ship_
3. _Lena_, the famous image used in image processing research
4. Donatello's _Penitent Magdalene_
5. A random picture of a park
6. A picture of Ian Somerhalder
7. A [fractal flame](http://flam3.com/flame.pdf)
8. A random picture of a smiling man's face
9. _The River_ a Fauvist painting by Andre Derain
10. Titian's _Venus of Urbino_
11. Picasso's _La Vie_
12. Seurat's _Le Chahut_

In essence, we wanted to answer the question: _what makes something beautiful?_ The [results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10N8JknAHfcGJABd0ETqWqru1g_Sphs8uDardLAnbnH8/edit?usp=sharing) were quite surprising (at least to my friend and I). Overall, the average of all the responses was only 5.81: incredibly close to the "average" of $$ \frac{1 + 10}{2} = 5.5 $$ (especially considering the number of responses). This suggests that beauty (at least to incoming college freshmen) is highly subjective. Half the people thought the images were beautiful, while the other half thought the images were ugly. This is also most likely independent of the images we chose, as evidenced by the fact that most of [the distributions](/assets/survey/survey_distributions.jpg) are centered around 5.5.

The responses for each individual image are also quite interesting. The first image, _Starry Night_, was not all that surprising. Here is the distribution and the picture: 

<center>

</center>

<center>
	<img src="/assets/survey/dist_1.jpg">
</center>

The graph is evidently heavily skewed toward the 10, with an average of 7.97. This is to be expected, as _Starry Night_ is both famous and seen as canonically beautiful. However, compare it's distribution to the next image, Turner's _Slave Ship_:

<center>
	<img src="/assets/survey/image_2.jpg">
</center>

<center>
	<img src="/assets/survey/dist_2.JPG">
</center>

Both distributions have a heavy skew as they're both pertty good looking, but _Starry Night_ has an odd peak at 10. Assuming that not many people have seen _The Slave Ship_, perhaps this suggests that societal influences are a big indicator of how people preceive beauty, or how people will _say_ how beautiful things seem to them. More people chose _Starry Night_ because they felt a pressure from society to rank it highly, while nobody felt any pressure to rank _The Slave Ship_ highly. In that sense, _The Slave Ship's_ distribution is probably more useful as an indicator of an individual's taste free from society. This phenomena actually happens again further down the list with Ian Somerhalder's picture:

<center>
	<img src="/assets/survey/image_6.jpg">
</center>

<center>
	<img src="/assets/survey/dist_6.jpg">
</center>

Again, there's a bump at 10, perhaps because Somerhalder is what society (or _People_ magazine) would call beautiful, or perhaps because he is so [well known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cebFWOlx848). It's also worthwhile to compare Somerhalder's picture with the other image of a man in the survey. This was just a random picture of a smiling man that we pulled from Google Images:

<center>
	<img src="/assets/survey/image_8.jpg">
</center>

<center>
	<img src="/assets/survey/dist_8.jpg">
</center>

Clearly, there's no bump at 10. But interestingly the smiling man's _average_ ranking is very close to Somerhalder's. The smiling man's average was 5.98 while Somerhalder's was 6.16. This is incredibly close considering the standard deviation for the smiling man is 2.17 while the standard deviation for Somerhalder is 2.39. Could it be that smiles make you look better?
