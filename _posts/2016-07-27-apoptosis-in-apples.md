### Aging iPhones

Just a couple weeks ago, I finally upgraded from an iPhone 4 to and iPhone SE. Just for some perspective, the iPhone 4 came out on June 24th, 2010; my brick of a phone was more than four years old (eons when talking about technology) when I finally shut the metaphorical coffin lid on it. It was so laggy that I had grown used to typing on frozen screens, waiting five minutes for a map to load, or apps randomly crashing.

The iPhone SE came as a relief, but it got me thinking: _when did I actually realize my old phone was slowing down?_ I soon realized that it was right after I updated from iOS 6 to iOS 7. Fishy? Sharon Moalem (see below) puts it this way: an iPod must die for the same reason you must die. That is, you must die to make room for newer models of yourself---your offspring---to supercede you and let evolution run its course. And your iPod must eventually die because room must be made for newer models. The death of an iPod or and iPhone is presumably initiated by Apple itself, but how?

### How an iPhone dies

Does Apple build its phones to slowly disintegrate over time? Does each phone contain a tiny self-destruct chip? Are there secret cell towers that Apple uses to send signals to phones throughout the world to tell them that their time is up? Sadly, no. Apple is in fact not run by an evil mastermind. What Apple does is that it builds each new iOS so that it runs much slower on new phones. This can clearly be seen using Google's powerful "Trends" tool:

What you're seeing is how often people search for the term "[iPhone slow](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=iphone%20slow&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4)" over the past 8 years. Each one of those spikes corresponds to the date Apple released a new iOS. Click the link in the first sentence of this paragraph to check the dates and see if they match these release dates:

+ iOS 2: July 11, 2008
+ iOS 3: June 17, 2009
+ iOS 4: June 21, 2010 (this peak is actually in July because it takes time for people to download the OS and realize it's slow)
+ iOS 5: October 12, 2011
+ iOS 6: September 19, 2012
+ iOS 7: September 18, 2013
+ iOS 8: September 17, 2014
+ iOS 9: September 16, 2015

Evidently, people are downloading the OS, realizing that their phone is running slow, and then googling for an answer to their problems. Peaks matching one or two dates might just be chance, but every single iOS release corresponding to a peak? Well, I'll just let the data do the talking. 

### But why?

You've probably already guessed it, but Apple slows down their phones with each new OS release slow they can make more profit. As their phones get slower, people will go out and buy the "latest model" or whatnot (it also helps that new apps can't run on old OS's). Phones, of course, naturally get slower through everyday wear and tear, but why not speed the process up a bit?

### Is it just Apple?

Short answer: yes. Here is a similar Google trends search for "[Android slow](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=android%20slow)"

And here are Android version release dates:

+ Cupcake: April 27, 2009
+ Donut: September 15, 2009
+ Eclair: October 26, 2009
+ Froyo: May 20, 2010
+ Gingerbread: December 6, 2010
+ Honeycomb: February 22, 2011
+ Ice Cream Sandwich: October 18, 2011
+ Jelly Bean: July 9, 2012
+ KitKat: October 31, 2013
+ Lollipop:	November 12, 2014
+ Marshmallow:	October 5, 2015

Incredibly, while Apple release dates seem to create a peak, at least two Android releases seem to have the opposite effect. Both the KitKat and Lollipop Android release seem to have caused the search frequency for "Android slow" to decrease. This can be understood by realizing that software updates can actually be used to add optimizations to phones, especially for older models, making them much more faster than before. While Android seems to be doing this, Apple seems to be doing the exact opposite.


Also, we can compare [similar search terms](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=iphone%20slow%2C%20android%20slow%2C%20phone%20slow%2C%20cell%20phone%20slow&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4) such as "Android slow," "phone slow," or "cell phone slow,"

+ Blue: "iPhone slow"
+ Red: "Android slow"
+ Yellow: "Phone slow"
+ Green: "Cell phone slow"

### Caveats



Google owns android can mess with data

Is this really that illegal? Not really, they have incentives too must make new models

#### P.S.

After writing this, I realized The Huffington Post had actually [written about this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/13/apple-new-iphones_n_5967626.html) in 2014. This is what they had to say:

_"It’s highly unlikely Apple deliberately slows down older iPhones just to get you to upgrade. The company declined to comment for this story. Instead, Apple designs the new operating systems, which have more features, take up more space and require more computing power, for the new iPhones. And a consequence of that is they don’t work as well on older iPhones."_
