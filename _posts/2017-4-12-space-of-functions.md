### The Space of Functions

Any function (from one fixed set to another fixed set) can be thought of as an element of a vector space. This is a pretty elementary fact from linear algebra and while it may sound a bit esoteric, it's not uncommon to actually manipulate the so-called "function space" when doing math. For example, one way of thinking of linear regression is to think of projecting a point in the function space (the function you want to approximate linearly) on to the subspace of linear functions (which is some plane of functions).

While the notion of a function space is useful, I don't feel that most people really get a feel for how significant a "function space" really is. Just think about it: _every single function_ exists in a function space. And every single relationship in the world is a function! Hooke's law? That the force needed to strech a spring is proportional to the distance streched? That's in a function space. The relationship between square footage of a house in San Fransisco, and it's selling price? That's in a function space. Even the relationship between _the sensory inputs of a your brain and the motor outputs of your brain_ is in a function space. Essentially, there is an (arguably) perfect model of _you_ in a function space. I could go on and on with more and more ludicrous examples, but I think you get the point.

In this light, a function space is so much more than just a mathematical object. It is a profound idea that seems to encapsulate so much. And I think it might help to explain why so many love math so much. When you do math, you're actually working with and manipulating these things beautifully deep objects, and discovering truth along the way.
