### Dimensionality

Let's consider the dimensions it takes to describe light. In computers, we can describe basically any color using the RGB color scheme. Each color is described using a tuple containing its red, green, and blue color on a scale from 1-255. For instance, Craylola's Razzmatazz has an RGB value of (227,11,92). Hence, Razzmataz is mostly red (227/255), and a bit of green and blue. This scheme allows us to represent just about any color, from jet black to bicycle yellow to wisteria to moonlight white.

So evidently, it takes three coordinates to describe a color. One for red, green, and blue. However, what about another way of representing light? What about representing light as a wavelength? Red light is about 700 nm and blue light is about 400 nm. In between 400 and 700 nm are the greens and the oranges and the yellows of the spectrum. Using this method we have one dimension, but we're still missing the blacks and the whites and the greys. To get these colors, we can just add one more dimension: the amplitude of a light wave. Low
