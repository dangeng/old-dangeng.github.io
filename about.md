Hello.

My name is Daniel Geng. I am a recent high school grad who hails from Ann Arbor, Michigan. Among my interests are coding, math, physics, and software art. Some not-as-nerdy pursuits that I enjoy include breakdancing, glowsticking, and ultimate frisbee. If anyone suddenly feels the urge to talk to me, they can reach me at:
