Hello! I'm Daniel Geng, a freshman at UC Berkeley who hails from Ann Arbor, Michigan. You can catch me coding, math-ing, physics-ing or meme-ing somewhere with a view. I also [blog about machine learning](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog) for Machine Learning at Berkeley.

Anyways, I see you've stumbled upon my humble little blog. Welcome! This is where I jot down interesting ideas that I have and chronicle my adventures for the world to see.

Feel free to contact me at:
